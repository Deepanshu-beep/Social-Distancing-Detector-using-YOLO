# Social-Distancing-Detector-using-YOLO

The uploaded Notebook conatins code which detects Social Distancinf Violations using YOLO Algorithms.

Approach used:
  Persons are detected using YOLO Algorithm.
  Euclidean Distance between every 2 persons is calculated.
  If the distance between any 2 persons is less than minimum distance required, those persons are shown in Red Bounding Box and the people following Social Distancing are shown in Green Bounding Box.
  
Here's a screenshot I've attached that depicts the output of the Video Processed
